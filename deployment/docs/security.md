# Security Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the application and deployment infrastructure.

## Authentication & Authorization

### Session Management
- Sessions are stored in the database
- Session expiration after 24 hours of inactivity
- Secure session cookies with HttpOnly flag
- CSRF protection implemented

### JWT Implementation
- Short-lived access tokens (15 minutes)
- Long-lived refresh tokens (7 days)
- Secure token storage
- Token rotation on refresh

## Data Protection

### Database Security
- Encrypted connections (SSL/TLS)
- Role-based access control
- Regular backups
- Data encryption at rest

### API Security
- Rate limiting
- Input validation
- Output sanitization
- CORS protection
- API versioning

## Infrastructure Security

### Network Security
- SSL/TLS encryption
- Firewall rules
- DDoS protection
- Network segmentation

### Container Security
